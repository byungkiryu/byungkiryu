Here we present a density-functional study of the electronic structure of Mn and Fe doped p-type BiSb-Te (p-BST) to investigate the effect of metal impurities on the thermoelectronic properties. Our calculations show that, for both Mn and Fe, the substitutional impurity at the Bi/Sb-site is the most stable geometry. Mn is a single acceptor, whereas Fe is an isovalent defect. The metal d bands are located within the host bands, not in the band gap. Due to the octahedral symmetry of the Bi/Sb-site, the metal d bands of Mn and Fe are split into three t2g and two e ∗ g states in the high spin configuration. The electronic charge distribution analysis reveals that occupied eg states are well resonant with the host valence bands. As the e ∗ g states are located near the valence band maximum, Mn and Fe impurities are expected to enhance the p-type Seebeck coefficient of BST.

In a certain solid material, TE voltage can be generated under temperature difference via Seebeck effect. Or, the electrical current can carry heat current via Peltier effect. These TE effects can be applied for industrial applications such as power generation from unused/waste heat and solid state cooling. TE phenomena are governed by three TE transport properties : Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivity. Classically, TE efficiency is determined by the ratio of three parameters given by the so-called zT. Hence balancing three parameters are key strategy toward high material efficiency. Advanced design of TE devices and their fabrications are also important topic for TE industrialization.","2021-10-21","2022-06-04 09:42:22","2024-03-28 10:47:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Online, Korea","","","Oral Invited","","","","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\WCDP57SK\BRyu_20211021_2021-KPS-fall_Computation Data-driven TE research v6.0_final.pptx; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\5GC9KIEG\Byungki 등 - Computation and Data-driven Research on.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\2D7HUXQD\초록.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\ZPX8HQN9\초록워드.docx","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","KPS 2021 Fall","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thermoelectric device, which is composed of thermoelectric material placed between hot and cold side temperatures, generates electricity via Seebeck effect. For highly efficient energy generation, tens to hundreds of P/N-leg pairs are serially circuited in a device. However, though the dimensionless figure of merit zT has been enhanced to near 2 in material levels, thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency is still below 10%, that is much lower than the limit of material conversion. In this work, we investigate the defect properties of thermoelectric materials that can affect the thermoelectric performance through first-principles density functional calculations. As an example, we choose the Mg-Si based thermoelectric material systems that is contacted to Al electrode layer. To overcome the band gap underestimation error, we adopt the hybrid-density functional for exchange correlation function and obtain the reliable band gap and charged defect formation energy.[1,2] From the charged defect formation energy, it is found that intrinsic and extrinsic defects can be easily generated affecting the Fermi level position and thermoelectric performance. Moreover, the nudged elastic band calculation reveals that the migration barrier of a defect can be lower than 1 eV. From the results, we suggest a thermoelectric leg degradation mechanism: impurity diffusion and charge trap formation model at the interface between thermoelectric material and metal contacts.[3,4] In addition to the material phase instability in the legs, the newly suggested defect trap generation model well explain the origin of increased contact resistivity in the thermoelectric legs, that is responsible for the unintentional energy loss by Joule heating in thermoelectric devices.

"BA3V63UE","presentation","2022","Ryu, Byungki; Chung, Jaywan; Park, Sungjin; Park, SuDong","Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA) and Average Thermoelectric Figure of Merit","","","","","","Thermoelectric heat engine transforms thermal energy directly into electrical energy via thermoelectric effects. Since Ioffe's formulation, thermoelectric material figure of merit ZT has been used for simple material evaluation [1]. However, there is no analytic expression for thermoelectric module efficiency for wide temperature applications owing to the nonlocality arising from temperature dependent thermoelectric properties [2]. In 2021, Ryu et al. reported that thermoelectric efficiency has three thermoelectric degrees of freedom (DOFs), indicating the inexactness of single parameter theory [3]. Meanwhile, recent mathematical analysis by Chung et al. proved that there is an explicit maximum efficiency formula when the Seebeck coefficient is temperature-independent, so called Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) [4]. In this model, the efficiency is a single-parameter function of ZeffTmid = <α>2 Tmid / <ρκ>, where α, ρ, κ, and Tmid are Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and middle of hot and cold side, and the bracket <.> indicates averaging over temperature. And the Zeff is exactly same to the one-shot approximation of the first DOF (Zgen(0)Tmid) in reference [4]. Here, we proposed a single parameter theory based on Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA) in which the temperature average Seebeck coefficient is regarded as a constant Seebeck coefficient in the CSM. Efficiency prediction accuracy of CSA using ZeffTmid was tested over 300 experimental thermoelectric properties data, and it was compared to other average ZT schemes and multiple parameter theories based on 3 DOFs. For slowly varying Seebeck coefficients, CSA theory not only provides a very accurate maximum efficiency formula, but also provides a very accurate approximate algebraic expression. Moreover, our CSA form outperforms previous averaging schemes such as integral Z, integral ZT, and engineering ZT. Finally, we extended the CSA theory to the design of segmented-leg module and p-n leg pair module. We believe that our simple CSA theory can be applied to module and system level thermoelectric conversion engineering.","2022-11-09","2022-06-04 10:27:22","2023-02-23 10:15:21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ramada Jeju Hotel, Jeju, Korea","","","Oral","","","","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\HJ5S3AGQ\Ryu 등 - 2022 - Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA) a.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ENGE 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This heavy computing cost also has been a bottleneck for materials simulations over large and long-time scale ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Recently, a universal Inter-Atomic Potential (IAP) for materials based on graph neural networks with three-body interactions, called M3GNet, was reported very recently in 2022-Aug [1]. The M3GNet IAP potential was reported to overcome the previous narrow chemical reaction of IAP potentials, by showing excellent energy prediction accuracy against conventional classical potentials. However, though the error of phase formation energy was found to be relatively small for bulk lattice prediction, it is not clear whether the M3GNet potential can be applied for other simulations cases, such as 2-dimensional defects. In this work, we test the M3GNet potential for prediction of defect formation energy and interface energy for various material systems. As a model system, we first investigate the intrinsic interface structure between the Bi2 bilayer and Bi2Te3 quintuple layer in Bi-Te homologue series [2], which is responsible for metastable structure of Bi-rich Bi2Te3 thermoelectric materials. It is found that the formation energy trends seem to be preserved within 20 meV/atom. Next, we investigate the coherent Cu/Ni2Si interface structures, which is crucial for precipitation hardening in Cu-Ni-Si alloys, as reported before [3]. After adding a fourth element, we calculate the change of interface energy compared to ideal Cu/Ni2Si interfaces. It is found that, without lattice cell relaxation, the M3GNet calculations well preserve the interface energies, compared to DFT-GGA calculations. However, when we performed the cell relaxation, not only the interface energies but also the cohesive energy of the fourth element varies significantly, compared to previous DFT results. It is speculated that, though the fixed-cell dynamics can be accurate, one should be very careful when simulating the lattice strain using M3GNet potential.  [1] C. Chen and S. P.

"QQMSLI25","presentation","2022","Ryu, Byungki","Thermoelectric Equations for Materials design and discovery, and Devices optimization","","","","","","Thermoelectric effects enable direct energy conversion between thermal energy and electrical energy. When temperature difference is applied between two ends of materials, an electrical voltage (or electromotive force, emf) is induced, which is called Seebeck effect. Or, flowing electrical currents induce thermal currents, that is called Peltier effect. These effects are governed by thermoelectric differential equations (TEQs) on temperature distribution.  In this presentation, I would like to introduce the relation between thermoelectric equations and realistic thermoelectric energy conversion. The coefficients of TEQs are determined from the temperature- and position-dependent thermoelectric material properties. Boundary conditions are determined from the device geometry and the corresponding temperature solution determines the thermoelectric device performance.

Moreover, there is limited number of reports on thermoelectric efficiencies from the experimental side. Thereby it is strongly desired to accurately predict thermoelectric efficiency for the wide application of thermoelectric conversion. Here, we report the best thermoelectric efficiencies of ever-explored materials [1]. We start from the world-largest thermoelectric database of Starrydata2.org [2], which contains more than 43000 material samples for thermoelectric properties from ~8000 publications, as of 2021-November-24. After data filtering, we obtain high-quality thermoelectric big data composed of ~13000 samples from ~3000 publications and their ideal material efficiencies were computed for various heat source temperatures when cold side is 300 K. The thermoelectric performances were investigated by solving one-dimensional thermoelectric integral equation for temperature solutions [3]. Using them, high-performance P- and N-leg candidates were chosen and ~14000 P-N leg-pair configurations were generated. Then, theoretical thermoelectric device efficiencies were computed with various electrical and thermal operation conditions, various geometries, various heat source temperature, and various interfacial electrical/thermal resistances. Finally, among 100,000,000 device efficiency calculations, the achievable best thermoelectric efficiency is explored. It is found that a single-stage device with ideal materials can achieve a high efficiency of 17.1% when hot side is 860 K, much higher than the current experimental record of 13% (~1/3). In a multi-stage device, an even higher efficiency of 24%(~1/4) is achievable when hot side is 1200 K. The extremely high efficiency of 33%(~1/3) can be possible in the infinite-cascade devices when hot side is 1400 K.","2023-04-27","2023-02-23 09:55:12","2024-10-27 14:21:07","2023-02-23 09:55:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Jeju ICC, Jeju, Korea","","","Oral","","","","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\MPT4XC5T\2023 04 26 류병기-금속재료-초록-best te efficiency map on te big data.docx","","","Condensed Matter - Materials Science; Physics - Computational Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","대한금속재료학회(KIM) 2023 Spring","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to low material performance near room temperature, there has been a limit in application to medium-temperature devices. On the other hand, a segmented thermoelectric power element composed of multi-layered legs is an advanced element technology that can maximize the performance of the element by using the optimum material for each temperature range. However, the technology has high technical difficulties such as bonding between segments to make legs and bonding between legs and electrodes.   In this study, we developed a high-performance medium-temperature segmented thermoelectric generator based on high-manganese silicide (HMS)-based materials. HMS was used to take charge of the high-temperature part of the P leg, and in the case of the N leg, the optimal material was searched for and selected from among materials possessed by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI), Korea and German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany. In order to overcome the low low-temperature properties of silicides, BiTe-based alloys were placed in the low-temperature region. The performance of various device legs and structures was predicted and calculated by calculating the thermoelectric equation that determines the temperature distribution of the thermoelectric leg, and based on this, the optimum material was searched and selected and the segment leg shape was determined. Finally, a long-leg type segment element stacked by bonding 4-5 mm of high-temperature material to a length of 3 mm of low-temperature material was designed and implemented. In the case of the low-temperature segment, Ni was plated, and in the case of the high-temperature segment, thermal stability was secured through simultaneous sintering. Finally, the leg and the subtrate were joined through solder/brazer. A 2-pair test device was developed, the electrical/thermal resistance values of the interface inside and outside the device were extracted and redesigned, and the final 8-pair silicide-based segmented thermoelectric generator device was developed. A thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency of more than 7% was achieved under the high-temperature condition of 450 degrees Celsius, and the efficiency level was confirmed by cross-evaluation through a joint research team in Germany.  This is the result of lowering the temperature of the high-temperature part by 100 degrees Celsius while showing equivalent conversion efficiency compared to previously reported silicide thermoelectric generators (7% @ high temperature 550 degrees Celsius, [1]).

The Seebeck effect generates electrical voltage when a temperature difference is applied across the device, while the Peltier effect couples electrical current with a reversible heat current. The efficiency of a thermoelectric device, as a heat engine, is a direct measure of its thermoelectric conversion ability. Despite the development of many high figure of merit materials, there have been limited studies on the practical implementation of thermoelectric devices for energy realization, and the achievable limit of thermoelectric efficiency remains unknown. In this presentation, we report on the best thermoelectric efficiency of ever-explored materials [1]. By filtering the thermoelectric property data from the world's largest thermoelectric property database (Starrydata2.org) [2], we obtain a high-quality thermoelectric big data set. Using thermoelectric integral equations based on the general thermoelectric efficiency theory of three thermoelectric degrees of freedom [3], we quickly and accurately predict the thermoelectric efficiencies of devices by solving for temperature solutions in P- and N-legs. By considering P-N leg-pair combinations, interface thermal/electrical resistances, leg geometries, and thermal and electrical working conditions, we have explored the efficiencies of 100 million devices based on 13,000 materials. Our results reveal that the best thermoelectric efficiency can reach over 17% in a single-stage P-N leg-pair device when the hot and cold side temperatures are 860 K and 300 K. With a leg-segmentation technology, this efficiency can be increased to 20% and 24% when the hot side temperature is changed to 850 K and 1100 K, respectively. In an infinite cascade model, a very high efficiency of 33% is possible with a heat source at 1400 K. However, there is a significant discrepancy between theoretical and experimental efficiencies, which may be caused by suboptimal material selection or the presence of significant parasitic thermal/electrical resistances that have not been fully considered. This highlights the need for a careful consideration and analysis of the underlying physics of thermoelectric devices for the wider implementation of thermoelectric power generation technology in the industrial and transportation sectors.

During the devel-opment of Mg2X (X = Si,Sn)-based thermoelectric generators we have repeatedly observed a (local) change of the Seebeck coefficient of the TE material arising from the interface with the contacting electrode. This phenomenon is observed for several electrode materials attached to Mg2X but also for other thermoelectric materials, and is related to the interdiffusion of doping species from the elec-trode into the TE material forming charged point defects. As TE materials require optimized carrier concentration, a change of carrier concentration results in a performance degradation. Hence, elec-trode-induced point defect formation is a major obstacle for the design of thermoelectric devices.  To address this challenge, we have developed an electrode pre-selection method based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of charged defect formation energies. Comparing the for-mation energies of intended point defects (to adjust optimal doping concentration) and potential elec-trode induced defects we can predict changes in the carrier concentration of the TE material. The cal-culation predictions for various candidate electrode materials are compared with microprobe meas-urements of the Seebeck coefficient. Excellent agreement was obtained, qualifying our approach as a method to exclude or shortlist elements as interface materials. A further challenge in understanding the electrode-TE material interaction (and the development of Mg2X-based TEG) is that degradation can also arise due to Mg loss from the Mg2X TE material, which changes the density of Mg-related intrinsic point defects and causes a detrimental change in carrier concentration. To distinguish between both degradation mechanisms, we have performed comparative stability investigations on Mg2X samples with and without ALD coating to suppress Mg sublimation. Cu as an electrode causes a significant carrier compensation, with Mg loss by sublima-tion a possible, small additive effect (for unprotected samples) while for Al contacts, Mg sublimation is the more relevant degradation mechanism, in agreement with the predictions from the DFT results. The principle approach is transferable to other material systems.","2023-06-21","2023-03-26 09:24:26","2025-04-24 15:15:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Seattle, US","","","Invited Oral","","","","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\DLHAHD5R\abstract_ICT_JdB_03.docx","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICT 2023","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"FZAYIHLZ","presentation","2023","Ryu, Byungki; Chung, Jaywan; Park, SuDong","Algebraic Approach to Predicting Thermoelectric Power Module Performance: with Temperature Dependent Properties and Contact Resistance","","","","","","Thermoelectric performance can be easily estimated using the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT. When thermoelectric properties are slowly varying with temperature, the performance can be accurately described within the constant property model (CPM). However, as thermoelectric properties are strongly temperature-dependent and there are non-negligible contact thermal and electrical resistances, there are difficulties for accurate performance prediction using the CPM model with ZT or the compatibility factor, thereby hindering device-level thermoelectric module design. Here, we would like to present an accurate yet simplified method to predict the performance of thermoelectric generator modules, considering both temperature-dependent properties and thermal/electrical contact resistances. This method is based on a thermoelectric integral formalism, recently developed by KERI. First, we will review the three-parameter theory, called the ""three thermoelectric degrees of freedom,"" which accounts for Thomson and asymmetric Joule heat. Then we will extend this theory for the thermoelectric algebraic representation for thermoelectric module performance prediction. Notably, this thermoelectric algebra can be used with electrical and thermal contact/interfacial resistances and temperature-dependent properties, without knowing the temperature distribution inside thermoelectric legs in a module. Furthermore, this algebraic approach can be used for advanced multistage-leg module design.

"5YC8SYVQ","presentation","2024","Park, Jongho; Jang, Jeongin; Ryu, Byungki; Park, SuDong","Fabricating Durable Silicide-Telluride Thermoelectric Modules through Chemically-Thermally-Designed Joining Process for Multiple Usability","","","","","","Thermoelectric modules convert temperature differences to electrical energy [1,2]. However, the modules faces fabrication challenges and performance drop due to metal-semiconductor interface resistance and material instability at high temperatures [2-5]. Traditional low-temperature soldering or liquid metal joining techniques can reduce long-term and consistent functionality due to significant performance degradation after operation or measurement, limiting multiple usability. More specifically, after operations at high temperatures, soldered modules experience a significant performance drop because the operating temperature is much higher than the melting point of the solder paste. And the modules may lose their functionality in discontinuous measurement and use. Meanwhile, brazing technology involves a high-temperature process that could potentially harm thermoelectric materials, as these temperatures might exceed the sintering temperature of the materials. In this presentation, to overcome these limitations, we applied chemically-thermally-designed brazing technology to thermoelectric generator module fabrication, enabling higher temperature operation and robust leg-substrate joining. We developed a silicide-telluride leg-pair thermoelectric generator module (TGM) using higher-manganese silicide (HMS) for p-type and Bi-doped PbTe (PbTeBi) for n-type. By selecting appropriate metallic layers and optimizing one-step sintering conditions, we minimized chemical and thermal damage during brazing at 650-750°C. The brazed 2-pair HMS-PbTeBi TGMs demonstrated a maximum power output of 0.43 W and an optimal efficiency of 4.4% at a temperature difference of 423°C (450°C hot side, 27°C cold side), maintaining stable performance under both continuous and discontinuous measurements. This indicates the successful fabrication of durable, multiple-use thermoelectric modules capable of operating effectively beyond room temperature conditions, marking a significant advancement in thermoelectric technology.

This performance, in turn, is limited within uniform bulk materials due to the interplay of three fundamental TE transport properties: the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Manipulating electronic band alignment in composite materials at the micro/nanoscale has the potential to disentangle these TE properties by selectively filtering charge carriers. Magnesium silicide-based materials, known for spontaneous nanostructured composite formation, emerge as preferred choices due to varying band gaps determined by the Si:Sn ratio. These materials exhibit promising TE properties in the 500-800 K temperature range, offering cost-effective and environmentally friendly options. Conventional bulk property measurements often lack sensitivity to detect subtle charge carrier filtering effects, necessitating micro/nano-scale characterizations of multi-phase materials[1]. Additionally, despite their potential, these materials face stability challenges, particularly due to magnesium loss over time[2]. To address these issues, our research employed Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) to simultaneously probe topography and the contact potential difference (CPD) of each phase over time. Time-dependent topography analysis at room temperature in ambient atmosphere revealed oxide layer formation, primarily in the Sn-rich phase grain boundary after a few days, escalating over time to encompass the entire Sn-rich region after a few weeks. Stability is closely tied to the Si:Sn ratio, as evidenced by minimal topography changes in the Si-rich region. The CPD provides the work function of individual phases, enabling estimation of the Fermi level position with respect to the vacuum level. Utilizing this information and first-principles calculations allows determination of band alignment at the interface of composite materials, facilitating optimization through effective energy filtering. The KPFM analysis approach represents a significant advancement in composite material optimization, providing insights into band alignment for effective energy filtering and studying stability over time to comprehend material degradation. This micro-nano scale characterization, addressing both stability and performance, is crucial for the practical application of these multi-phase materials.

Since Ioffe's formulation, thermoelectric material figure of merit ZT has been used for simple material evaluation [1]. However, there is no analytic expression for thermoelectric module efficiency for wide temperature applications owing to the nonlocality arising from temperature dependent thermoelectric properties [2]. In 2021, Ryu et al. reported that thermoelectric efficiency has three thermoelectric degrees of freedom (DOFs), indicating the inexactness of single parameter theory [3]. Meanwhile, recent mathematical analysis by Chung et al. proved that there is an explicit maximum efficiency formula when the Seebeck coefficient is temperature-independent, so called Constant Seebeck-coefficient Model (CSM) [4]. In this model, the efficiency is a single-parameter function of ZeffTmid = <α>2 Tmid / <ρκ>, where α, ρ, κ, and Tmid are Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and middle of hot and cold side, and the bracket <.> indicates averaging over temperature. And the Zeff is exactly same to the one-shot approximation of the first DOF (Zgen(0)Tmid) in reference [4]. Here, we proposed a single parameter theory based on Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation (CSA) in which the temperature average Seebeck coefficient is regarded as a constant Seebeck coefficient in the CSM. Efficiency prediction accuracy of CSA using ZeffTmid was tested over 300 experimental thermoelectric properties data, and it was compared to other average ZT schemes and multiple parameter theories based on 3 DOFs. For slowly varying Seebeck coefficients, CSA theory not only provides a very accurate maximum efficiency formula, but also provides a very accurate approximate algebraic expression. Moreover, our CSA form outperforms previous averaging schemes such as integral Z, integral ZT, and engineering ZT. Finally, we extended the CSA theory to the design of segmented-leg module and p-n leg pair module. We believe that our simple CSA theory can be applied to module and system level thermoelectric conversion engineering.","2024-11-26","2024-11-29 16:50:20","2024-12-12 05:21:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Shinhwa Resort, Landing, Jeju","","","Oral","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ENGE 2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"QMFXRJH6","presentation","2025","Ryu, Byungki; Park, Sungjin; Wani, Aadil Fayaz; Chung, Jaywan; Park, SuDong","(Invited) Defect rich thermoelectric materials and device physics","","","","","","Thermoelectric materials contain abundant defects, significantly affecting charge transport properties. For example, intrinsic defects are responsible for charge transport in BiSbTe and BiTeSe alloy systems. Regulating alloy composition or introducing extrinsic defects enables Fermi-level tuning to optimize electronic thermoelectric properties. Additionally, high-dimensional large-size defect formation such as precipitation plays a crucial role in phonon scattering by controlling defect size and distribution. Despite their importance, the fundamental nature of defects in thermoelectric materials and their role in device physics remains poorly understood. One key characteristic of thermoelectric materials is their relatively large lattice parameters, which facilitate the easy formation of defects. However, a precise understanding of these mechanisms requires a quantitative analysis. In this presentation, we provide an analysis of the defect characteristics of various thermoelectric materials based on first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) and hybrid-DFT calculations. In many thermoelectric materials, point defect formation energies are below 1 eV [1], leading to a high defect density of up to approximately 1020 cm-3. Moreover, some defects can easily diffuse over the whole lattice [2]. Upon heating, point impurities from phase boundaries or electrode interfaces can diffuse into grains [3]. Even at room temperature, certain defects can be created at surfaces or grain boundaries and migrate into the grain interior, affecting material stability [4].  Finally, we discuss the various types of defects in thermoelectric materials: shallow dopants, charge trap centers, charged complex defects, and anharmonic defects. In SnTe–Ag and PbTe–Bi alloys, formation of defect clusters may finetune thermoelectric properties, finetuning carrier concentration and regulating charge scattering mechanism [5,6]. However, in Mg-based alloys, interactions between defects and formation of charge trap centers cause long-term thermoelectric performance instability [3,4]. Meanwhile, the off-centered Pb interstitials in PbTe exhibit long-range lattice relaxation, which might enhance lattice anharmonicity [7]. We believe that these findings not only provide a deeper understanding of defect-driven thermoelectric properties but also offer guidelines for optimizing material stability and long-term performance in practical thermoelectric devices.
