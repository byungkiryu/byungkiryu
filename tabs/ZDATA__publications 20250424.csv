The band spectrum shows that hole carriers are spatially confined whereas electrons move more freely through the whole crystal. The characteristics of a superlatticestructure appears especially in the flat boundary structure.

However, these properties often change in unfavorable directions owing to the spontaneous formation of vacancies at high temperatures. Although it is crucial to maintain high thermoelectric performance over a broad temperature range, the suppression of vacancies is challenging since their formation is thermodynamically preferred. In this study, using PbTe as a model system, it is demonstrated that a high thermoelectric dimensionless figure of merit, zT ≈ 2.1 at 723 K, can be achieved by suppressing the vacancy formation via dopant balancing. Hole-killer Te vacancies are suppressed by Ag doping because of the increased electron chemical potential. As a result, the re-dissolution of Na2Te above 623 K can significantly increase the hole concentration and suppress the drop in the power factor. Furthermore, point defect scattering in material systems significantly reduces lattice thermal conductivity. The synergy between defect and carrier engineering offers a pathway for achieving a high thermoelectric performance by alleviating the power factor drop and can be utilized to enhance thermoelectric properties of thermoelectric materials.","2021-10-20","2021-10-21 10:51:31","2021-10-21 10:51:41","2021-10-21 10:51:31","2100895","","20","8","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/advs.202100895","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\XD9EDJU2\Jang 등 - 2021 - Regulating Te Vacancies through Dopant Balancing v.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\9LFCMR8Q\advs.html","","","defect engineering; power factor; re-dissolution; thermal conductivity; thermoelectrics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to raise the operation temperature on the basis of Bi2Te3 technology, S element was introduced into Bi2Te3 to synthesize a ternary tetradymite compound, Bi2Te2S, and the thermoelectric properties were analyzed. In this study, Bi2S3 was considered, instead of using elemental S, to avoid the issues arising from the volatility of S. Compared with Bi2Te3, undoped Bi2Te2S shows higher Seebeck coefﬁcients (Smax ¼ À210.9 mV KÀ1 at 523 K) but also higher resistivity (rmin ¼ 26.5 mU m at 323 K), resulting in decreased power factor (PFmax ¼ 1.49 mW KÀ2mÀ1 at 373 K). However, low thermal conductivity (kmin ¼ 0.987 WKÀ1mÀ1 at 473 K) produced higher ZT at T ! 423 K than Bi2Te3, reaching about 0.66 at 473 K. At the same time, the bipolar conduction was reduced due to the enlarged band gap of about 0.22 eV, which was estimated from the S-T curve. After additional hot deformation at 793 K, undoped Bi2Te2S shows remarkably improved values of power factor (PFmax ¼ 2.62 mW KÀ2mÀ1 at 323 K) and ZT (ZTmax ¼ 0.86 at 473 K), which was ascribed to increased carrier concentration. In addition, the highly anisotropic transport properties of Bi2Te2S were suggested to be another origin, which was revealed by the ﬁrst-principles calculations. In summary, Bi2Te2S is a promising candidate for thermoelectric generation at the intermediate temperature region 473e573 K where Bi2Te3 shows degraded performances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Our results indicate that, in addition to the extrinsic doping strategy, alloying of Mg2Sn with Mg2Si under Mg-poor conditions would be necessary to enhance the p-type conductivity with less charge compensation.","2021-02-05","2020-09-24 11:12:25","2022-06-06 14:07:41","2021-05-17 06:30:12","157145","","","853","","Journal of Alloys and Compounds","Native point defects and low p-doping efficiency in Mg2(Si,Sn) solid solutions","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\H97GB4G5\1-s2.0-S092583882033509X-mmc1.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\V56R99CU\1-s2.0-S092583882033509X-mmc2.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\56QEYCCL\1-s2.0-S092583882033509X-mmc3.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\2HDTUY3E\1-s2.0-S092583882033509X-mmc4.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\F5PK2PWU\1-s2.0-S092583882033509X-mmc5.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\6GTUUE5Z\1-s2.0-S092583882033509X-mmc6.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\Z5B29UEQ\Ryu 등 - 2021 - Native point defects and low p-doping efficiency i.pdf","","thermoelectric; defect; first-principles; thermoelectric material; silicide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using density-functional calculations, we reveal that Ag impurity defects occupying interstitial sites in the BST affect the formation of intrinsic defects in the host materials. Ag interstitial defects, which are responsible for increasing the lattice parameter of the c axis, lower the formation energies of BiTe and SbTe acceptor defects more effectively in the Bi-rich BST than in the Bi-poor BST. In addition, these Ag interstitials induce the formation of AgBi and AgSb in BixSb2−xTe3. Therefore, Ag-induced defect interactions can be used to finely optimize the defects and doping density by varying the Bi content.

The defect levels lie to within 10 meV from or below the valence band edge for nanowires with diameters larger than 33 Å and the Ge fractions above 30%.

In carbon nanotubes, the migration pathways and barriers of a monovacancy depend on the tube chirality, while there is no preferential pathway in graphene due to the lattice symmetry and the absence of the curvature effect. The probable pathway changes from the axial to circumferential direction as the chirality varies from armchair to zigzag. The chirality dependence is attributed to the preferential orientation of the reconstructed bond formed around each vacancy site. It is energetically more favourable for two monovacancies to coalesce into a divacancy via alternative movements rather than simultaneous movements. The energy barriers for coalescence are generally determined by the migration barrier for the monovacancy, although there are some variations due to interactions between two diffusing vacancies. In graphene and armchair nanotubes, two monovacancies prefer to migrate along different zigzag atomic chains rather than a single atomic chain connecting these vacancies. On the other hand, in zigzag tubes, the energy barrier for coalescence increases significantly unless monovacancies lie on the same circumference.","2014-03-19","2014-03-12 06:12:16","2014-03-12 06:12:16","2014-03-12 06:12:16","115303","","11","26","","J.

We clarified the origins of the electronic and thermal transport properties of Cux+yBi5−yS8 compounds based on the change in the composition, which is strongly correlated with the occupancy of each atomic site. Ab initio calculations revealed that the narrow gap n-type semiconducting nature of Cux+yBi5−yS8 compounds originates from the presence of interstitial Cu ions. Structural refinements combined with transport measurements revealed that asymmetrical disorders of interstitial Cu ions have a large anisotropic thermal displacement factor, leading to an intrinsically low value (∼0.49 W m−1 K−1) and temperature-independent behavior of lattice thermal conductivity. Comprehensive structural analysis provided an elemental doping strategy focusing on interstitial sites. Thermoelectric properties were significantly enhanced by the simultaneous increase of power factor and decrease of lattice thermal conductivity. It is noted that structural factors, such as occupancy and thermal displacement parameter, of interstitial sites among the various crystallographic sites should be considered as primary characteristics in the crystal chemistry of complex structured crystals.

However, conventional bulk TEMs generally have in-plane dimensions of a few centimeters, and empty space between the legs for electrical isolation makes efficient miniaturization difficult. In this study, a miniature TEM with footprint of about 0.35 cm2 and leg height of 0.97 mm was fabricated by reducing the dimensions of the legs and attaching them together to form a closely packed assembly, without using microelectromechanical processes. First, Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 (BST) and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 (BTS) ingots were made by ball milling and spark plasma sintering, and the ingots were cut into thin plates. These BST and BTS plates were then attached alternately using polyimide tapes, and the attached plates were sliced vertically to produce thin sheets. This process was repeated once again to make chessboard-like assemblies having 20 p–n pairs in an area of 0.35 cm2, and electrical contacts were formed by Ni sputtering and Ag paste coating. Finally, thermally conductive silicone pads (~500 μm) were attached on both sides of the assembly using electrically insulating interface thermal tapes (∼180 μm). The maximum output power (P max) from the miniature module was about 28 μW and 2.0 mW for temperature difference (ΔT) of 5.6°C and 50.5°C, respectively. Reducing the contact resistance was considered to be the key to increase the output power.","2016-05-09","2016-07-26 06:41:49","2016-07-27 05:14:46","2016-07-26 06:41:49","3453-3459","","7","45","","Journal of Elec Materi","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","link.springer.com","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\H5EQ5RVP\Joo et al. - 2016 - Fabrication of Miniature Thermoelectric Generators.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\C9P5Q3P6\s11664-016-4560-z.html","","","thermoelectric module; Characterization and Evaluation of Materials; Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation; Optical and Electronic Materials; Solid State Physics; power generation; fabrication; miniaturization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The results indicate that protonic ruthenium oxide is an excellent candidate for use as a ﬂexible, transparent conducting material. A hydrated-ruthenium-oxide sheet has been ﬁrst prepared via the chemical exfoliation of sodium intercalated ruthenium oxide (NaRuO2) and, subsequently, converted into a protonic ruthenium oxide sheet using thermal treatment. A thermally activated transport mechanism is dominant in hydrated ruthenium oxide but diminishes in protonic ruthenium oxide; this resulted in a high electrical conductivity of ∼200 S/cm of the protonic sheet.

Herein, we successfully synthesize multistructured thermoelectric Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 materials with Fe-rich nanoprecipitates and sub-micron FeTe2 inclusions by a conventional solid-state reaction followed by melt-spinning and spark plasma sintering that could be a facile preparation method for scale-up production. This study presents a bismuth antimony telluride based thermoelectric material with a multiscale structure whose lattice thermal conductivity is drastically reduced with minimal degradation on its carrier mobility. This is possible because a carefully chosen FeTe2 incorporated in the matrix allows its interfacial valence band with the matrix to be aligned, leading to a signiﬁcantly improved p-type thermoelectric power factor. Consequently, an impressively high thermoelectric ﬁgure of merit ZT of 1.52 is achieved at 396 K for p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3−8 mol % FeTe2, which is a 43% enhancement in ZT compared to the pristine Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3.

The quantum confinement and chemical bonding effects play a role in stabilizing donor-pair defects against isolated substitutional donors. As the donor-pair defect has a deep level in the band gap, which is electrically inactive, the doping efficiency is reduced in small-diameter nanowires. As the Ge concentration increases, the formation of the donor-pair defect becomes more favorable, lowering further the doping efficiency. On the other hand, with As and Sb dopants, which have the larger atomic radii, the formation of donor-pair defects is suppressed due to large strain energies.

The formation energies of VO have a tendency to increase with increasing number of neighboring Ga atoms, whereas they are generally low in the environment surrounded with In atoms. Thus, adding Ga atoms suppresses the formation of O-deficiency defects, which are considered as the origin of device instability in a-IGZO-based thin film transistors. The conduction band edge state is characterized by the In s orbital and insensitive to disorder, in good agreement with the experimental finding that increasing the In content enhances the carrier density and mobility. In a-IGZO, while most VO defects are deep donors, some of the defects act as shallow donors due to local environments different from those in crystalline oxides. As ionized O vacancies can capture electrons, it is suggested that these defects are responsible for positive shifts of the threshold voltage observed under positive gate bias stress. Under light illumination stress, VO defects can be ionized, becoming V2+O defects due to the negative-U behavior. When electrons are captured by applying a negative bias voltage, ionized V2+O defects return to the original neutral charge state. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we find that the initial neutral state is restored by annealing, in good agreement with experiments, although the annealing temperature depends on the local environment. Our calculations show that VO defects play an important role in the instability of a-IGZO-based devices.","2011-09-15","2014-03-17 01:16:19","2025-01-01 16:00:39","2014-03-17 01:16:19","115205","","11","84","","Phys.

Ag-defects can be either donor, acceptor, or isovalent neutral defect. When Ag is heavily doped in PbTe, the neutral (Ag-Ag) dimer defect at Pb-site is formed and the environment changes to the Pb-rich/Te-poor condition. Under Pb-rich condition, the ionized Ag-interstitial defect (Ag I +) becomes the major donor. The formation energy of Ag I + is smaller than other native and Ag-related defects. Also it is found that Ag I + is an effective dopant. There is no additional impurity state near the band gap and the conduction band minimum. The charge state of Ag I + defect is maintained even when the Fermi level is located above the conduction band minimum. The diffusion constant of Ag I + is calculated based on the temperature dependent Fermi level, formation energy, and migration energy. When T &gt; 550 K, the diffusion length of Ag within a few minutes is comparable to the grain size of the polycrystalline PbTe, implying that Ag is dissolved into PbTe and this donor defect is distributed over the whole lattice in Ag-excess doped polycrystalline PbTe. The predicted solubility of Ag I + well explains the increased electron carrier concentration and electrical conductivity reported in Ag-excess doped polycrystalline PbTe at T = 450–750 K [Pei et al., Adv.

Accordingly, a projection of them into a finite-dimensional space is inevitable for use in computers. In this paper, as a dimension reduction method, we validate the use of high-order polynomial interpolation of TEPs at Chebyshev nodes of the second kind. To avoid the numerical instability of high order Lagrange polynomial interpolation, we use the barycentric formula. The numerical tests on 276 sets of published TEPs show at least 8 nodes are recommended to preserve the positivity of electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity. With 11 nodes, the interpolation causes about 2% error in TEPs and only 0.4% error in thermoelectric generator module performance. The robustness of our method against noise in TEPs is also tested; as the relative error caused by the interpolation of TEPs is almost the same as the relative size of noise, the interpolation does not cause unnecessarily high oscillation at unsampled points. The accuracy and robustness of the interpolation indicate digitizing infinite-dimensional univariate material data is practicable with tens or less data points. Furthermore, since a large interpolation error comes from a drastic change of data, the interpolation can be used to detect an anomaly such as a phase transition.","2020-08-10","2020-08-13 13:59:21","2023-04-03 02:15:29","2020-08-13 13:59:21","13456","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","Crossref","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\JJJZQY8C\Chung 등 - 2020 - Dimension reduction of thermoelectric properties u.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\RL8XI4KQ\response-SciRep.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as material properties can vary strongly with T, efﬁciency predictions based on ZT can be inaccurate, especially for widetemperature applications. Moreover, although ZT values continue to increase, there has been no investigation of the relationship between ZT and the efﬁciency in the higher ZT regime. In this paper, we report a counterintuitive situation by comparing two materials: although one material has a higher ZT value over the whole operating temperature range, its maximum conversion efﬁciency is smaller than that of the other.

Zgen is the well-defined mean of the traditional zT under nonzero temperature differences. The two additional parameters τ and β are gradients of material properties and crucial to evaluating the heat current altered by nonzero Thomson heat and asymmetric Joule heat escape. Each parameter is a figure of merit. Therefore, increasing one of the three DoFs leads to higher efficiency. Our finding explains why the single-parameter theory is inaccurate.

Under strong anisotropy, there was a mismatch between the Seebeck coefficients of the porous medium obtained from numerical simulation and theoretical prediction.

The high transmittance (≈79%) of the metal thin film in the visible range is attributed to the presence of an oxide subsurface layer which acts as antireflection.

The as-sintered sample exhibited material separation into a multiphase mixture of cubic Sb-rich AgSbTe2 (Ag21Sb28Te51), monoclinic Ag2Te with an inhomogeneous distribution, and an Sb-rich zone. The samples were subjected to heat treatment for 24 h at 523, 573, and 673 K. The results indicated that AgSbTe2 was metastable against Ag2Te and Sb2Te3 at 573 K. The accelerated kinetics induced the separation of AgSbTe2 into less-Sb-rich δ’-AgSbTe2 and Sb2Te3 with sub-µm sizes. The observations also revealed that AgSbTe2 was stable against Ag2Te and Sb2Te3 at 673 K. Micrometer-scale Ag2Te precipitates and rhombohedral Sb2Te3 phases were dissolved in the main matrix. Furthermore, single-phase δ-AgSbTe2 was stabilized with nanoscale precipitates of Ag2Te and Sb-rich nanodots. The thermoelectric transport properties of the heat-treated samples were investigated. The results indicated that the thermoelectric performance of the single-phase metastable structure with nanoscale precipitates was superior to that of the multiphase structure. Multiphase AgSbTe2 exhibited a low thermal conductivity; however, the effective Seebeck coefficient was balanced by the presence of multiple phases. This resulted in a low thermoelectric power factor. Metastable single-phase AgSbTe2, with Ag2Te and Sb-rich nanodots, exhibited a high Seebeck coefficient with a slightly low p-type conductivity. This resulted in a high thermoelectric power factor, and the presence of nanoscale precipitates lowered the thermal conductivity.

By breaking the higher symmetry imposed on the on-centered interstitial defects, the lowest ground state of Pb interstitial defects is off-centered along the [1¯1¯1¯] direction. Because of the four multi-stable structures with low defect-formation energies, the defect density of Pb interstitials is expected to be approximately six times higher than previous predictions for PbTe synthesized at 900 K. In contrast to the on-centered Pb interstitials, the off-centered Pb interstitials in PbTe can exhibit long-range lattice relaxation in the [111] direction beyond a distance of 1 nm, indicating the potential formation of weak local dipoles.

While n-type Mg2(Si,Sn) has excellent TE properties, p-type shows suboptimal TE performance because of insufficient carrier concentration, in particular for Mg2Si and Si-rich Mg2(Si,Sn). A systematic investigation of Li-doped Mg2Si1-xSnx has been performed as Li, in contrast to other typical dopants, has a high solubility in the material system and has been shown to yield the highest reported carrier concentrations. We observe that the carrier concentration increases with Li content, but the dopant efficiency decreases. With respect to the Si:Sn ratio, we find a clear increase in maximum achievable carrier concentration and dopant efficiency with increasing Sn content. The trends can be understood by employing defect formation energies obtained within the hybrid-density functional theory (DFT) for the binaries. Further, we use a linear interpolation of the hybrid-DFT results from the binaries to the ternary Mg2(Si,Sn) compositions and a simple single parabolic band model to predict the maximal achievable carrier concentration for the solid solutions, providing a simple guideline for experimental work. Finally, we show that the approach is transferable to other material classes. This work highlights that, besides dopant solubility, the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic defects determines the achievable carrier concentration.","2022-06-01","2022-06-01 15:39:02","2024-04-21 07:26:43","2022-06-01 15:39:02","035001","","3","4","","J.

Data from temperature dependent characterization of the PF is provided to assess functional stability and homogeneity under integral measurement conditions. The outcome of certification measurements at PTB report on individual uncertainty contributions as the base for a later testimony of FeSi2 as a metrological reference for the PF. Integral measurements have been expanded to further comparative test results obtained by the Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI), the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), and the Netzsch Gerätebau GmbH.

Despite the benefit of direct thermal energy-to-electricity conversion, conventional STEG optimization approaches are unable to provide a systematic method for selecting the optimal multiple stacks of p- and-n-type thermoelectric materials (TEs) legs from a set of numerous TE materials. In this study, we propose a systematic optimization method based on machine learning to find the optimal STEG for performance maximization. A deep neural network (DNN) is trained using an initial dataset generated via the Finite Element Method (FEM), with inputs including the temperature-dependent properties of p- and n-type TE materials, the lengths of each segment, and external loads, as well as the corresponding performance outputs. The trained DNN captures the inherent nonlinear relationship between these inputs and outputs. The combination of a trained DNN and a genetic algorithm (GA) efficiently navigates a vast design space using 88 p-type and 70 n-type TE materials along with device factors. It formulates four stacked segment pairs in p- and n-leg TEGs, targeting new superior designs with enhanced power, efficiency, or both. The DNN is iteratively refined via active learning (AL) by incorporating new superior STEG designs to enhance prediction accuracy. The optimized STEGs exhibit power and efficiency that are 1.91 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than the top designs from the initial training dataset composed of 157.916 STEGs.

This study optimizes a free-form hole shape for square and hexagonal lattice aluminum plate PnCs with high relative bandgaps (i.e., ratio of bandgap to its center frequency). Optimization is implemented by leveraging the predictive capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs). For both types of lattices, an initial training dataset is made up of 20,000 randomly generated PnCs unit cells, each containing a symmetric smooth hole. The relative bandgap is subsequently evaluated using the Finite Element Method (FEM). For each lattice, one Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained to predict the relative bandgap, while another DNN is used to classify whether the bandgap exists. The predictive power of DNNs is exploited to search for design candidates with high relative bandgaps using the genetic optimization algorithm (GOA). The relative bandgaps of new candidates are determined and validated using FEM. The results of these analyses are then utilized to update the DNNs through active learning (AL) techniques.

The bottleneck for this is the material-specific design of the interface between the thermoelectric material and the electrical connections, particularly identifying suitable contacting electrodes. This has mainly been empirical, slowing down device maturation due to the vast experimental space. To overcome this, an electrode pre-selection method based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of charged defect formation energies is established in this work for the first time. Such method allows to predict thermoelectric leg degradation due to impurity diffusion from the electrode into the thermoelectric material and formation of charge carrier traps, causing a majority carrier compensation and performance deterioration. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, the charged point defect formation energies of relevant metal electrodes with Mg2(Si,Sn) are calculated. Five hundred ten defect configurations are investigated, and the interplay between intentional doping and electrode-induced point defects is predicted. These predictions are compared with Seebeck microprobe measurements of local carrier concentrations near the Mg2(Si,Sn)-electrode interface and a good match is obtained. This confirms the feasibility of electrode screening based on defect formation energy calculations, which narrows down the number of potential electrodes and accelerates device development.","2024-08-31","2023-03-14 09:22:36","2025-01-21 16:41:42","2024-01-29 11:25:57","2300077","","1","3","","","High-Performance Thermoelectric Devices Made Faster","","","","","","","en","© 2023 The Authors.

This acceleration is attributed to the influence of Cu solutes on the Zn phase, thereby reducing the interface energy between Zn precipitates and the Al matrix. The Al–Zn–Cu alloy demonstrates exceptional behavior during tensile tests, displaying a simultaneous increase in tensile strength and ductility alongside an 75 % reduction in area at room temperature drawing. Notably, despite the drawn beyond uniform deformation limit, there is an observed increase in total elongation.

Typically, cast alloys contain a higher quantity of elements to enhance strength. The increased content of additive elements inevitably escalates the precipitation driving force. However, this can result in heterogeneous nucleation, leading to the formation of large particles at grain boundaries, consequently impeding the strengthening process. Managing the shape and structure becomes pivotal to address this challenge. The Cu alloy, enriched with 6 wt% Ni, 1.3 wt% Si, and 2.4 wt% Mn, possesses a high precipitation driving force due to the abundance of solutes in the matrix at high temperature. Upon cooling in air following heat treatment at 980 ◦C for 8 h (homogenization), both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation and growth processes occur within the grain interior and at the grain boundaries. The phase heterogeneously formed at the grain boundary is identified as Ni2Si compound in the Cu-Ni-Si alloy, while the phase at the grain boundary is recognized as Mn6Ni16Si7, known as the G-phase. The presence of G-phase at the grain boundary results in higher strength and ductility compared to the alloy with Ni2Si. The substantial coverage of the grain boundary by the film-shaped G-phase renders the grain boundary more stable than the irregularly shaped Ni2Si, consequently contributing to the elevated strength and ductility of the Cu-Ni-Si alloy.","2024-09-01","2024-07-29 22:43:52","2024-07-29 22:44:04","2024-07-29 22:43:52","114198","","","215","","Materials Characterization","","","","","","","","en","All rights reserved","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\96WRPYYY\Han 등 - 2024 - Enhanced strength of Cu-Ni-Si alloy via heterogene.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we present a simplified thermoelectric algebra framework for predicting TGM performance within the constant Seebeck coefficient approximation (CSA). First, we revisit the constant Seebeck coefficient model (CSM) to transform the differential equations into exact algebraic equations for thermoelectric heat flux and conversion efficiency in terms of the load resistance ratio and relative Fourier heat flux. Next, we introduce the CSA, where the Thomson term is neglected and the device parameters are assumed to be fixed. We define the average thermoelectric properties and device parameters under the zero-current condition using a simple temperature integral. Finally, we derive approximate thermoelectric algebraic equations for voltage, resistance, heat flux, and conversion efficiency as functions of current. We numerically validate that the CSA formalism is superior to other single-parameter theories, such as peak-ZT, integral-ZT, and generic engineering-ZT, in predicting efficiency. The relative standard error of the optimal efficiency is less than 11% for average ZT values not exceeding 2. By combining the CSM and CSA, TGM performance can be easily estimated without requiring calculus or solving differential equations. Therefore, this simplified thermoelectric algebra under the CSA framework has the potential to significantly enhance future TGM analysis and design, facilitating more efficient device-level research and development beyond the traditional focus on material properties.","2025-02-04","2025-02-04 10:40:02","2025-02-04 10:40:02","2025-02-04 10:40:02","055001","","5","137","","Journal of Applied Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\ADNL7YGN\Ryu et al. - 2025 - Thermoelectric algebra made simple for thermoelect.pdf; C:\Users\cta4r\Zotero\storage\KP5SXBHM\Thermoelectric-algebra-made-simple-for.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This has been emphasized by several thermoelectric generator prototypes, demonstrating technological maturity. However, material stability is paramount for large-scale applications whereas we reveal here that the thermal stability of n-type Mg2(Si,Sn) may be limited even at room temperature (RT). Integral thermoelectric properties measurements, locally resolved Seebeck coefficient analysis, scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy are employed to assess changes of n-type samples stored in ambient atmosphere for years, revealing the evolution of the carrier concentration and transport properties in the material as well as surface degradation. This is caused by the diffusion of loosely bound Mg from the bulk towards the surface and subsequent oxidation, leading to a change of Mg-based intrinsic defect concentrations, thereby degrading the thermoelectric performance. This microscopic mechanism is backed up by first-principles calculations, revealing that Mg diffusivity in Mg2(Si,Sn) is high at RT and that diffusion occurs mainly via Mg vacancies. The observed much faster degradation of Sn-rich Mg2(Si,Sn) can be correlated with the higher density of Mg vacancies in Mg2Sn compared to Mg2Si, as predicted from defect formation energies.","2025-02-26","2024-02-03 07:21:26","2025-02-28 15:51:26","2025-02-28 15:50:23","2300298","","3","5","","","","","","","","","","en","© 2024 The Authors.

In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-leg materials. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg’s ZT because an external wire is necessary to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg efficiency. Our findings explain the overestimation of single-leg efficiency and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure.
