# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm Byungki Ryu

I am a Principal Researcher at the **Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI)** and a faculty member at **UST (University of Science and Technology), Korea**.

## ðŸ§­ Research Statement

Byungki Ryu is a transdisciplinary thermoelectric researcher exploring the fundamental principles of energy conversion, material-device coupling, and quantum-informed interface and defect design for next-generation thermoelectric systems. He leverages first-principles modeling, FEM-based simulations, experimental design, and machine learningâ€“assisted property analysis. His recent work focuses on enhancing thermoelectric generator performance, developing thermal information encoding strategies, and expanding the understanding of incommensurate (irrational-ratio) interface structures through the integration of data-centric and physics-informed approaches.
