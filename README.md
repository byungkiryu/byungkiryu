# 👋 Welcome! I'm Byungki Ryu

I am a Principal Researcher at the **Korea Electrotechnology Research Institute (KERI)** and a faculty member at **UST (University of Science and Technology), Korea**.

## 🧭 Research Statement

Byungki Ryu is a transdisciplinary thermoelectric scientist, over theory and experiment: 
exploring the fundamental physics to application, phenomena to energy conversion, 
material & device interaction, 
and designing quantum-informed interface and defect structures for next-generation thermoelectric systems. 
His recent work focuses on enhancing thermoelectric generator performance 
and understanding of incommensurate inter-phase boundaries.
His intersts expand to develop thermal information encoding strategies.
